# Why Protocols Matter?

- Protocols are required for computers to properly communicate across the network. 
- In both a wired and wireless environment, a local network is defined as an area where all hosts must "speak the same language", which, in computer terms means they must "share a common protocol".

- If everyone in the same room spoke a different language, they would not be able to communicate. 
- Likewise, if devices in a local network did not use the same protocols, they would not be able to communicate.

- Networking protocols define many aspects of communication over the local network. 
- These include message format, message size, timing, encoding, encapsulation, and message patterns.
