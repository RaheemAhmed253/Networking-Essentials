# The Protocol Stack

- Successful communication between hosts requires interaction between a number of protocols. 
- These protocols are implemented in software and hardware that are installed on each host and networking device.

- The interaction between the different protocols on a device can be illustrated as a protocol stack, as shown in the figure.

- A stack illustrates the protocols as a layered hierarchy, with each higher-level protocol depending on the services of the protocols shown in the lower levels.

- The separation of functions enables each layer in the stack to operate independently of others. 
- For example, you can use your laptop computer connected to a cable modem at home to access your favorite website, or view the same website on your laptop using a wireless connection at the library. 
- The function of the web browser is not affected by the change in the physical location, nor the method of connectivity.
