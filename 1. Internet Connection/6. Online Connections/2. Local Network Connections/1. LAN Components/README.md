# LAN Components

- In addition to smart phones and mobile devices, there are many other components that can be part of a local area network.
- Some examples of network components are personal computers, servers, networking devices, and cabling.
- These components can be grouped into four main categories:

   - Hosts
   - Peripherals
   - Network devices
   - Network media

## Hosts

- Hosts send and receive user traffic.
- A host is a generic name for most end-user devices.
- A host has an IP address.
- Examples of hosts are personal computers and network attached printers.

## Peripherals

- Shared peripheral devices do not communicate directly on the network. 
- Instead, peripherals rely on their connected host to perform all network operations.
- Examples of shared peripherals are cameras, scanners, and locally attached printers.

## Network Devices

- Networking devices connect other devices, mainly hosts.
- These devices move and control network traffic. 
- Examples of network devices include hubs, switches, and routers.

## Network Media

- Network media provides connections between hosts and network devices.
- Network media can be wired, such as copper and fiber optic, or use wireless technologies.
