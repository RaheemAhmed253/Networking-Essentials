# SOHO 

- Local networks come in all sizes.
- They can range from simple networks consisting of two computers, to networks connecting hundreds of thousands of devices.
- Networks installed in small offices, or homes and home offices, are referred to as small office/home office (SOHO) networks.
- SOHO networks let you share resources such as printers, documents, pictures, and music, between a few local users.
- In business, large networks can be used to advertise and sell products, order supplies, and communicate with customers.
- Communication over a network is usually more efficient and less expensive than traditional forms of communication, such as regular mail or long distance phone calls. 
- Networks allow for rapid communication such as email and instant messaging, and provide consolidation and access to information stored on network servers.
- Business and SOHO networks usually provide a shared connection to the internet. 
- The internet is considered a "network of networks" because it is literally made up of thousands of local networks that are connected to each other.
